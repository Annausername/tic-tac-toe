# TIC-TAC-TOE

Tic-Tac-Toe is a game in which two players (player vs computer) seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three o's or three x's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares; noughts and crosses. In this particular game player is an 'x' by default and the computer is 'o'.

### Existing Features

## Features

- __Modules__

  Some modules had to be imported in order to add certain functionalities to the application.

![os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html): is used to create a function that clears the terminal. This checks if the operating system is either Windows or Linux and triggers the necessary command to delete everything visible in the terminal screen.
![sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html): is used only in the typewriter function to print every character of the string individually.
![time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html?highlight=time#module-time): this is also used in the typewriter function to create a delay between each character and also a delay after the function prints the whole message.
