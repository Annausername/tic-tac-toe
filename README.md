# TIC_TAC_TOE

Tic-Tac-Toe is a game in which two players (player vs computer) seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three o's or three x's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares; noughts and crosses. In this particular game player is an 'x' by default and the computer is 'o'.

__As a player__

- I want to play a game with clear and easy instructions;
